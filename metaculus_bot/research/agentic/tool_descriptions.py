"""Driver-facing text for the public agentic tools: descriptions + JSON parameter schemas.

This is what the gap-fill v2 driver LLM reads when it decides which tool to call, so the
wording is behavioral rather than documentation: the descriptions steer
search_news-vs-search_web routing, promise that ``fetch`` handles PDFs / JS pages / images
so the driver does not avoid a URL by format, and spell out the ``start_char`` pagination
contract. Split out of ``tools.py`` so the prose sits in one place and the module holding
the fetch ladder stays readable; ``build_gap_fill_tools`` (``tools.py``) pairs each
description + schema with its handler.
