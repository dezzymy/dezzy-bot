"""Tests for ``metaculus_bot.cli.main`` — the ``sys.exit`` wiring that fires when
``TemplateForecaster.alertable_count > 0``, when the donated OpenRouter key fell back to the
operator's personal (paid) key during the run, or when a Mantic post was dropped, plus the
emit-then-raise ordering that keeps the end-of-run breakdown on a run whose forecast failed.

Publication already happened inside ``forecast_on_tournament`` by the time cli
checks alertable state; the non-zero exit is purely so GitHub Actions marks
the run red. That wiring is load-bearing — without it, forecaster drops,
stacker fallback usage, silent personal-key spend, and a draining donated
balance all go unnoticed.

The fallback-counter arithmetic and the dated credit-alert window are pinned in
``test_cli_credit_alerts.py``.
